As we discussed before, many programs, particularly ones from the GNU Project,
support both short and long command line options.
For example, to display a help message for many of these programs,
you may use either the "-h" option or the longer "--help" option.
Long option names are typically preceded by a double dash. 
We will adopt this convention for our scripts.
